Use MuonPOG to produce ntuples and add trigger, cuts. 
Fit to these resonance ntuples.
Use macros to update the plots' style.

MuonPOG: https://github.com/battibass/MuonPOG/tree/80X
First: produce ntuples: https://github.com/battibass/MuonPOG/tree/80X/Tools/test/crab
       update the dataset, global tag.
       add cuts: https://github.com/battibass/MuonPOG/tree/80X/Tools/invariant_mass
       update the triggers and add other cuts you want.
Second: use roofit to these ntuples and you can correct the PDF you want.
